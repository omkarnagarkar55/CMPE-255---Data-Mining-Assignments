1. **Dataset used for analysis** - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales
2. **Following prompt was used in Chat GPT chat to optain the results:-**

    "As an industry Data Science expert and an expert in CRISP-DM methodology, given a kaggle  data set to predict the profitability of sales at superstore, can you do step by step EDA analysis as an Industry Data Science expert explaining every step to a master student who is new to Data Science field.Your response should be textbook quality.Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in principled fashion on data understanding, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, data pre processing, feature selection,  data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, regression for prediction of income using variety of methods comparing to a baseline, providing proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendation. Use your most popular ml package like scikit etc,.. Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk. It is important to chunk this above problem. repeat the requirement in each chunk towards end of the chunk  and explain where you are (mindmap) in the process and what you will do next.Make sure to include charts and graph where ever its neccessary for better understanding. Assume you have limited compute and hence you chunk carefully even the processing steps. I will ask you to continue after each step.Also make sure that you do not lost the session state."
