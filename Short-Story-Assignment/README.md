### Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for addressing imminent healthcare challenges like rising costs and demand. This paper reviews RL techniques in natural language processing (NLP), emphasizing biomedical applications.

### Methods
A systematic review methodology adhering to PRISMA guidelines was followed. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 6 databases, yielding 89 relevant English papers over the past decade.

### Results
RL concepts like states, actions, and rewards enable formulating NLP tasks as sequential decision problems. Reviewed NLP applications benefiting from RL include dialogue systems, question answering, machine translation, text summarization, and information extraction. Analysis shows prevalent usage of policy gradient, deep RL, and Q-learning methods.

### Discussion
Despite progress in healthcare NLP, responsible model usage warranting attention to privacy, quality, interpretability, and ethics is imperative. A conceptual timeline illustrates the acceleration in adopting machine learning for enhanced diagnosis, patient engagement, genomics, and knowledge retrieval.

### Conclusions
Traditional NLP struggles with complexity whereas neural networks excel at semantics. RL suits interactive decision-making. Caution around data biases underscores the need for trustworthy NLP system design ultimately enabling improved accessibility, clinical support, and patient outcomes.
