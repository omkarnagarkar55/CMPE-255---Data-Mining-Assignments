# CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD Assignments

This repository showcases three distinct projects, each employing a unique data mining methodology: CRISP-DM, KDD, and SEMMA. Dive into each directory to explore the iPython Notebook, the associated research paper, and insightful ChatGPT conversations.

**Project Directories:-**
1. CRISP-DM Methodology Project
2. KDD Methodology Project
3. SEMMA Methodology Project

## Methodologies :-

1. **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**
CRISP-DM is a widely recognized methodology for data mining projects. It provides a structured approach to planning and executing data mining tasks.

Phases:
* **Business Understanding**: Define the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
* **Data Understanding**: Collect, describe, and explore the data to become familiar with its quality and structure.
* **Data Preparation**: Clean, transform, and enrich the data to construct the final dataset.
* **Modeling**: Select and apply various modeling techniques, calibrate their parameters, and evaluate their performance.
* **Evaluation**: Assess the models to ensure they meet the business objectives and requirements.
* **Deployment**: Implement the model into the business operation and monitor its performance.

2. **KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)**
KDD is the process of discovering useful knowledge from a collection of data. It involves the use of databases along with machine learning and statistics techniques.

Phases:
* **Selection**: Choose the relevant data from the database.
* **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise and inconsistencies.
* **Transformation**: Convert the data into a suitable format or structure for mining.
* **Data Mining**: Apply algorithms to extract patterns from the transformed data.
* **Interpretation/Evaluation**: Interpret and evaluate the mined patterns to gain knowledge.

3. **SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess)**
SEMMA is a methodology developed by SAS Institute for data mining projects. It emphasizes the iterative nature of data mining.

Phases:
* **Sample**: Extract a representative dataset from the large volume of data.
* **Explore**: Analyze the data to identify trends, anomalies, and relationships.
* **Modify**: Transform the data to create, select, and transform variables to focus on the modeling objectives.
* **Model**: Apply various modeling techniques to the data to create predictive or descriptive models.
* **Assess**: Evaluate the models to ensure they are accurate and reliable.
