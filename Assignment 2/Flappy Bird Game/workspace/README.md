Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the Flappy Bird game:

1. Model:
   - Bird: Represents the bird in the game and handles its movement and collision detection.
   - Pipe: Represents the pipes in the game and handles their movement and collision detection.
   - Game: Manages the game state, including the score and game over conditions.

2. View:
   - Renderer: Renders the game elements on the screen.

3. Controller:
   - InputHandler: Handles keyboard input and controls the bird's movement.

4. GameEngine: Manages the game loop and updates the model and view accordingly.

5. main.py: The entry point of the game.

6. test_game.py: Contains unit tests for the game using pytest.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

**main.py**
