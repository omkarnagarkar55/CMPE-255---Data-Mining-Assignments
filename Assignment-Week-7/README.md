# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

Welcome to the Week 7 assignments for the CMPE-255 Data Mining course. This week, we focus on dimensionality reduction techniques, exploring various methods and their applications on different datasets.

## Notebooks:

1. **Dimensionality Reduction on Wine Dataset**

   - Description: This notebook demonstrates the application of dimensionality reduction techniques using Databricks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. Clone the repository and navigate to the "Assignment-Week-7" directory. Open the desired notebook and run the cells sequentially.

### Installation
To run these notebooks, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, umap-learn (Install these using pip or conda)

## Steps Followed For Each Dataset

- Data Loading: Load the datasets for analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
- Applying Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: Apply various dimensionality reduction techniques and analyze their effectiveness.
- Visualization: Visualize the results of dimensionality reduction.
- Further Analysis: Perform clustering or classification tasks on the reduced datasets.
